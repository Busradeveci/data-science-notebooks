# Data Science Notebooks

This repository contains my personal notes and learnings from the **Data School** YouTube channel, where I studied various topics related to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Python programming. The notes are written in both English and Turkish, with added insights and explanations to facilitate understanding and personal growth in data science.

### **Table of Contents**

- **Pandas Basics**
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- **Data Visualization**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**
- **Advanced Python Programming**

These notebooks are a collection of key concepts, examples, and exercises that I worked through while following the Data School tutorials. Some explanations have been adjusted for clarity and additional insights based on my personal understanding and exploration of each topic.

### **About the Data School**

**Data School** is a popular YouTube channel and resource created by **Kevin Markham**, offering tutorials on data science and machine learning using Python. The videos are rich with information and practical examples. However, I took the liberty of translating and restructuring the content to better fit my learning style, and I've included additional notes and clarifications where necessary.

### **Learning Journey**

This repository represents my journey in learning data science and machine learning, focusing primarily on Python and libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**. My goal was to understand the core concepts of data manipulation, data cleaning, and building machine learning models.

### **Usage**

Each notebook in this repository corresponds to a different lesson or concept that I've learned. Feel free to explore the notebooks for educational purposes and, if necessary, modify them to fit your own learning process.
